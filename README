Usage:	mdtest [-h] [-c] [-f first] [-i iterations] [-l last] [-s stride] [-n #]
               [-p seconds] [-d testdir] [-r] [-t] [-u] [-v] [-y] [-D] [-F]
               [-N #] [-S] [-V #]

	-h: prints this help message
	-c: collective creates: task 0 does all creates and deletes
	-d: the directory in which the tests will run
	-f: first number of tasks on which the test will run
	-i: number of iterations the test will run
	-l: last number of tasks on which the test will run
	-n: every process will creat/stat/remove # directories and files
	-p: pre-iteration delay (in seconds)
	-r: only remove files or directories left behind by previous runs
	-s: stride between the number of tasks for each test
	-t: time unique working directory overhead
	-u: unique working directory for each task
	-v: verbosity (each instance of option increments by one)
	-y: sync file after write completion
	-D: perform test on directories only (no files)
	-F: perform test on files only (no directories)
	-N: stride # between neighbor tasks for file/dir stat (local=0)
	-S: shared file access (file only, no directories)
	-V: verbosity value

NOTES:
 * -N allows a "read-your-neighbor" approach by setting stride to tasks-per-node
