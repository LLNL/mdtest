Fixes in mdtest-1.8.3
 * Prepared for release on sourceforge.net

Fixes in mdtest-1.8.2
 * With the new changes issued in mdtest-1.8.0, all files and directories
   were operated upon by using the full path to each file/dir.  Full paths
   are no longer used.  Now a relative path is used from the root dir of 
   each directory tree.
 * fixed bug in collective creates and unique directory per task mode

Fixes in mdtest-1.8.1
 * A new test directory is created for each iteration.  Then for each 
   iteration the directory structure is created/removed.  This allowed 
   multiple iterations of the create-only mode.  The name of the test 
   directories has changed as a result of this fix.  Also, aggregate 
   creation/removal times are computed now over the number of iterations.

Changes in mdtest-1.8.0
 * added option to create files/dirs in tree-like directory structure: 
   Previously, all files/dirs were created in one test directory.  Now the 
   root directories of the tree(s) are created in that test directory.  
   Files/dirs are then created within those root directories or their children.
   If the -u flag is specified, then unique trees are created per proc.  
   Otherwise, one tree is created.  This coincides with the previous 
   functionality.  The following flags were added/changed to incorporate this 
   new feature:
    -z #: Indicates the depth of the leaves of the tree.  If this flag is not 
          specified, the depth defaults to 0 (i.e. files/dirs are created in 
          the top-level directories).
    -b #: Indicates the branching factor of the tree.  If this flag is not 
          specified, the branching factor defaults to 1.  Branching factor 
          indicates the number of children that each non-leaf node has.
    -L:   Indicates that files/dirs should only be created at the leaf level 
          of the tree.
    -I #: Indicates the number of files/dirs that should be created within 
          each directory of the tree.
    -n #: This flag still indicates the total number of files/dirs that should
          be created.  However, with the new tree structure some calculations 
          are done to determine the number of files that should be created per
          directory in the tree.  Due to rounding the actual total number of 
          files may differ slightly from what is specified.  
   
 * added option to choose which phases to run:
   The create, stat, and remove phases of mdtest have been separated.  There 
   are flags now that allow the user to choose which phases they want to 
   perform.  If none of these flags is specified, then the default usage is 
   to do all of the phases.  The user is trusted to be intelligent about their
   choice of phases.  As a result of the separation of the phases, the naming 
   convention of the files/dirs had to be altered slightly.
          
 * added option to not barrier between each phase (create/stat/remove):
   A major change in mdtest is the ability to time each proc that is running 
   the different phases of mdtest.  The default functionality is the same as 
   the previous version - barriers are taken between phases (create/stat/
   remove).  Also, in the default case, the resultant times reflect the 
   slowest rates for each phase.  If the -B flag is specified, then no barriers
   are taken between the phases.  There is a race condition when specifying 
   this flag, but it is rarely met.  The race condition is that one proc might
   be trying to remove a file in the shared file case before someone else has 
   a chance to stat the file.  Also, when the -B flag is specified, the 
   resultant rates are aggregates over the number of iterations and the number
   of procs used.  The default case, as mentioned above, calculates aggregates
   only over the number of iterations where the time for each phase of an
   iteration is the time of the slowest proc for that particular phase.
   
 * added option to stat files/dirs in a random order:
   The default usage of mdtest will stat files in sequential order.  Now, 
   however, items can be stat'ed in a random order by specifying the -R flag.
   Even though the stat order is random with this usage, items are still only 
   stat'ed once each.  This is achieved by randomly sorting a list of unique 
   item IDs before running the different tests.  A seed for the random number 
   generator can optionally be provided with the following syntax: -R#.

Fixes in mdtest-1.7.5
 * changed bug in how test directory was created (race condition)
 * added multipath option for test directories ('-d path1@path2@path3')
 * added man page and correct malloc error-checking (patches from Jim Garlick)

Fixes in mdtest-1.7.4:
 * folded b_remove_0 branch into main HEAD branch

Fixes in mdtest-b_remove_0:
 * added remove option to only remove files from previous run

Fixes in mdtest-pre_b_remove_0:
 * simple clean up for preparing for branch

Fixes in mdtest-1.7.3:
 * added statfs() to get file system data block and inode usage, replacing
   system() call

Fixes in mdtest-1.7.2:
 * initialized declared variables
 * modified df disk usage call
 * added error-checking for chdir()

Fixes in mdtest-1.7.1:
 * added '-y' option to sync file after write
